# MyRecordStore API Design

## Introduction

In this activity, you will design (but not build) a REST API that will enable management of a Record Store's inventory.

## Requirements

You will only generate a simple specification.

The API must enable the following functionality:

- Create a record

- Retrieve a single record by id

- Update a record

- Delete a record

- Retrieve all of the records

Each endpoint must include the following information:

- URI with path variables

- HTTP method

- HTTP response status (in case of success)

- Request body (if required&mdash;otherwise "none")

- Response body (or "none")
