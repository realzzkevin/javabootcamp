# Recipe Service Test Suite

The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain experience unit-testing the controller portion of a Spring Boot REST web service while using a mock repository.

## Assignment

Create a comprehensive unit test suite for the REST endpoints of the given Recipe web service using Spring MockMvc. Implement test cases for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations for Ingredients, PrepSteps, Ratings, and Recipes.

Throughout your test case, mock the corresponding repositories accordingly and provide them to the controllers.

Specifics for the API can be found in the `recipe-service-api-documentation.md` file, which is located in the `starter` folder.
